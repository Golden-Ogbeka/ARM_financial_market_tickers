## Technical Questions

1. How long did you spend on the coding test?<br />
   <b>Answer</b>: 10 hours
2. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you did not spend
   much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you
   would add.<br />
   <b>Answer</b>: I would add a page to get similar news so users can be well immersed in the site
3. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your
   chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you have used it.<br />
   <b>Answer</b>: NextJS 13 allows you to directly fetch data and use that data in your component. Making it easier to fetch and refetch requests. I didn't use Next 13 because it was returning server error when I deployed to Netlify. I installed the netlify plugin to help solve this but the solution didn't last. I therefore reverted to version 12 of NextJS. I was able to deploy to Vercel but had to stay within the requirements of this test
4. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had
   to do this?<br />
   <b>Answer</b>: Yes, by using google's lighthouse feature to note what is causing the delay and then optimizing images and the code to ensure better performance
5. How would you improve marketaux that you just used?<br />
   <b>Answer</b>: Create an api to get list of supported countries. I had to hardcode that part because no api was provided
6. On a scale of 1-10 what would you rate yourself?<br />
   <b>Answer</b>: 9
